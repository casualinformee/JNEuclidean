Description: An attempt to clone HackerPoet's NonEuclidean Game Engine into JOGL

Several weeks ago, I watched CodeParade's video[(link here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8) in which he created a game engine using OpenGL in order to create Non Euclidean worlds. I though it was pretty cool, had an awesome concept, so I cloned the repository and started messing around with it. It took about 0 minutes for me to realize that I had pretty much no experience in C++ or OpenGL. So I got the idea in my mind to try and replicate the engine, but entirely in Java, a language I do have experience with.

I thought it would be a fun way to teach myself JOpenGL. So, here's my attempt.

Run the compile.sh script to compile and run.
